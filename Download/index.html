  <h2>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</h2>

  <p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common type of therapy often used to treat anxiety disorders as well as
    depression. According to scientific research studies, CBT is as effective in the treatment of depression as
    antidepressants.</p>

  <p>The most optimal treatment plan is medication in conjunction with therapy. However, this is context-dependent. If
    a person is living with anxiety and feels that they don't need medication, CBT is a great place for that
    individual to start. The focus of CBT is on helping you understand your thoughts and thought patterns. Our
    thoughts can actually impact our moods. With the coping techniques of CBT, you have the power to change your
    feelings as well as your behaviors.</p>

  <p><a href="/master/CBT">CBT</a> teaches you about cognitive distortions. Often, we are unaware of these unhealthy
    patterns of thinking until we learn about how they impact our lives in a negative way, and at that point, we can
    change the way we think about things. Read further is see if you personally experience some of the following
    cognitive distortions: </p>


  <h2>1. Filtering</h2>
  <p>This means that you take the negative details and magnify them. Then you ignore the positive attributes of a
    situation. For example, a person could focus on one negative thing and ruminate on it. Then their perspective of
    the situation is distorted in a negative light.

  </p>

  <h2>2. "Black and White" Thinking’</h2>
  <p>In this distortion, you see things as "black-or-white." There are no shades of gray or middle ground. Either you
    are perfect or you are a complete failure. There is no in-between, and we know that this is inaccurate in life.

  </p>
  <h2>3. Overgeneralization</h2>
  <p>This means that you are concluding something based on one thing that happened. Just because something occurs one
    time, it doesn't mean it will happen every subsequent time. This is an overgeneralization, and it can be
    destructive to your thinking.

  </p>
  <h2>4. Jumping to Conclusions/Mind Reading</h2>
  <p>You cannot know what another person is thinking. In this distortion, you are jumping to a conclusion, because of
    your emotional reaction to another person. It's better to ask that person how they feel rather than assume it.</p>

  <h2>5. Catastrophizing</h2>
  <p> This means that you imagine a terrible scenario where a horrible thing happens based upon a tiny detail. For
    example, if your friend doesn't call you back, you might assume that she hates you and no longer wants to be your
    friend or that she died.

  </p>
  <h2> 6. Personalization </h2>
  <p>Personalization means that you believe that it is about you. An event occurs and you are convinced that it was
    because of you. Someone's negative response is because you did something wrong. In reality, there are a number of
    factors at play here and it's not necessarily all about you.</p>


  <h2>7. Control Fallacies</h2>
  <p>You see yourself as helpless and a victim of fate. There is nothing you can do to change your life because it is
    predetermined and hence you are doomed. This is inaccurate, and you do have the power to make decisions and
    advocate for yourself.</p>

  <h2> 8. Fallacy of Fairness </h2>
  <p>Life isn't fair; we've heard this time and time again. However, lamenting about how you are being treated
    unfairly and there is a vast conspiracy against you is also an exaggeration. Balance in life can happen, and it’s
    important to recognize that.</p>

  <h2>9. Blaming</h2>
  <p>It's important to take responsibility and be accountable for your actions. If you feel a certain way, it isn't
    because of someone else. They could have said something that hurt your feelings, but they didn't "make you feel
    that way." It's not productive to tell someone "You made me feel bad." What's more productive is to say, "I feel
    hurt when you say ___." Use your I-statements and you will avoid this distortion.</p>


  <h2>10. Should Statements</h2>
  <p>Have you ever heard the saying "stop shoulding all over yourself"?When we say "I should do ___," it induces guilt
    and shame in us. There is no need to say, "I should be" or "I ought to" because there is no rule book for life.
    You are free to make your own decisions about what’s best for you.</p>


  <h2>11. Emotional Reasoning</h2>
  <p>You feel a certain way; therefore, it must be the truth. Feelings are not the ultimate indicator of what is
    logically true. You could feel that someone is angry with you, but until you check in with them and ask, you won't
    know the truth.</p>

  <h2>12. Fallacy of Change</h2>
  <p>We believe that we have the power to change other people if we cajole them enough. This isn't true. A person will
    change, if they want to, on their own time.</p>

  <h2>13. Labeling</h2>
  <p>"I'm a failure," "I'm a bad friend," "I am stupid." These are all examples of labeling. It's unhelpful to call
    yourself names. You are a human being with a multitude of qualities, but you are not one thing. We all have flaws,
    but we are not exclusively identified by them.</p>

  <h2>14. Always Being Right</h2>
  <p>Nobody is right all the time. In fact, there is no right and wrong in a given argument. There are subjectivity
    and different people's perspectives. You have your opinion and I have mine. We could be looking at the same shade
    of green and you think it's blue, while I insist that it's green. No one is right in this situation. It's a matter
    of opinion.</p>

  <h2>15. Heaven's Reward Fallacy</h2>
  <p>We believe that if we do the right thing, we will be rewarded somehow in life. This couldn't be further from the
    truth. Bad things happen to good people and vice versa. There is no one keeping score, and we do the best that we
    can in our lives.</p>

  <p>Learning coping techniques associated with CBT, including cognitive distortions and thought records are
    extraordinarily helpful for people with anxiety and depression. CBT provides that level of insight into our
    thinking and has the capacity to better our lives.</p>

    <h1>What's Mindset CBT ?</h1>
    <p>
      Mindset CBT is a company created to help more folks get access to
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Mindset CBT is based off CBT and can be
      used to do exercises during therapy and even for self help personal
      use.Mindset CBT helps you solve negative thoughts in secs.Its very
      fast and easy to use.
      <a href="/open-source">Distortions</a> are what we find in these
      negative thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      We see Mindset CBT CBT as a "front-door" to professional help. Many
      people neglect seeking a therapist or psychiatrist because they don't
      feel their problem is "big enough" or they're not aware just how
      effective CBT can be.Most of your probeoms could be solved by this ap
      with a 100 years worth of research on the human mind.
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy &amp; Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      Mindset CBT treats your thoughts as the most <em>sensitive</em> possible
      data, because it <em>is</em> your most sensitive possible data.
    </p>
    <p>
      So like rational people:
      <strong>we do not record or store your thoughts.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We don't want to know your thoughts. When you record something in
      Mindset CBT, it lives on your phone, not on some server in Ohio or
      something. In the future, we may create a cloud-sync feature. If we do
      this, your thoughts will be
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_encryption">client-side encrypted</a>. They'll be encrypted
      on your phone and <em>then</em> sent to us, so
      no one at Mindset CBT will ever be able to read your thoughts.
    </p>
    <h3>Data we <em>do</em> record</h3>
    <p>
      As much as we'd like to know as little as possible about you, we have
      to make a few compromises to keep the lights on. But we'd rather be as
      explicit about what we're doing as possible, so you can make an
      informed decision to trust us or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Error logs</strong> If Mindset CBT has a bug, we want to know
      about it ASAP. If we don't, it can cause real harm, like corrupting
      your data. To avoid this, we collect logs from your phone that
      include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The IP address of your phone</li>
      <li>The type of phone that the error happened to. (ex: iPhone XS)</li>
      <li>
        Some "hints" we've left in the code that help us figure out what
        just happened.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is shared with Sentry, a bug-tracking third party
      tool that we trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Behavioral Data</strong> In order to create a product that's
      actually useful for people, we collect anonymous, event-based,
      behavioral data. That means when you do something in the app like
      follow up on a prediction, we get sent a message that looks like this:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>User 15412315 followed up on a prediction</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Nearly every tech product behavioral analytics, but Mindset CBT
      specifically only uses <em>anonymous</em> behavioral analytics.
    </p>
    <p>
      By <em>anonymous</em>, we mean we don't connect this to any personally
      identifiable information. In other words, we don't know that "George
      Freedman in Ohio" followed up on a prediction, just that
      <em>someone</em> followed up on a prediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we could, we'd avoid anonymous analytics. But we've compromised
      here for two reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first is that our error logs are not good enough on their own to
      alert us of bugs. For example, if a bug disables an entire feature, we
      may not get any error logs since no one is able to access the feature.
      But if the number of people recording predictions drops to 0, then
      it's likely that it's broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second is that we must build something that people actually want
      and use. That means that if we release a new feature and it isn't
      being used or it's somehow disliked, we'll just remove it. We're not
      in the business of creating a bloated product, we're in the business
      of making something that helps you feel better.
    </p>
    <h2>Who makes this?</h2>
    <p>
      Thought Book is created and maintained by
      <a href="https://github.com/erosson">Mark Anyang</a>. Most of the hard
      work was done in the past, by the Insight folks. I'm just a volunteer
      here to keep the lights on!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thought Book - Insight's predecessor - was developed by
      <a href="https://twitter.com/evanjconrad">Mark Anyang</a>, who codes,
      draws the cute bubbles, and is generally worried about everything and
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kobyconrad/">Insight (Thought Books creator)</a>, who does the marketing
      and business stuff, and is generally
      optimistic and calm about everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mindset CBT originally started as a tool Mark Anyang made to help with his
      panic attacks. It's still that, but now it helps all sorts of folks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Special thanks to the clincial psychologist
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mireille-reece-33ab357/">Dr. Mireille Reece</a>, for her guidance on

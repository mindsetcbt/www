      relationship between you and your healthcare providers and not replace it. We are not liable or responsible for
      any consequences of your having read or been told about such advice or other materials as you assume full
      responsibility for your decisions and actions. In particular, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we make no
      representation or warranties about the accuracy, completeness, or suitability for any purpose of the advice, other

    <h2>12.4 NO WAIVER</h2>
    <p>If we delay exercising or fail to exercise or enforce any right available to us under these Terms, such delay or

    <p>We will not be liable to you for any lack of performance, or the unavailability or failure, of the Products, or

    <h2>12.7 ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
    <p>(a) Applicable laws require that some of the information or communications we send to you should be in writing.

      mainly electronic. We will contact you by e-mail or provide you with information by posting notices on the
      Products. You agree to this electronic means of communication and you acknowledge that all contracts, notices,
      information and other communications that we provide to you electronically comply with any legal requirement that
      such communications be in writing.</p>

    <p>(c) You have the right to receive a paper copy of the communications. To receive a paper copy, please request it
      by emailing us at help@mindsetcbt.com</p>
    <p>(d) We may charge you a reasonable service charge to mail you a paper copy of any communication. We will either
      include such service charge on our fee schedule or we will first inform you of the charge and provide you with the
      choice as to whether you still want us to send you a paper copy. Please be sure to state that you are requesting a
      copy of the particular communication.</p>

    <p>(e) To receive and view an electronic copy of the communications you must have the following equipment and
      software:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>(ii) an Internet web browser which is capable of supporting 128-bit SSL encrypted communications, JavaScript,
        and cookies. Your system or device must have 128-bit SSL encryption software. Your access to this page verifies

    </ul>

    <p>(f) To retain a copy, you must either have a printer connected to your personal computer or other device or,
      alternatively, the ability to save a copy through use of printing service or software such as Adobe Acrobat®. If

      text into a new document in the word processor or text editor and save the text.</p>
    <p> You can also contact us via email at <a href="">help@mindsetcbt.com</a> to unsubscribe from further

    <p>(h) We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to discontinue the provision of your electronic communications,
      or to terminate or change the terms and conditions on which we provide electronic communications. We will provide
      you with notice of any such termination or change as required by law.</p>

    <h2>Modifications, Termination, Interruption and Disruptions to the Platform</h2>
    <p>You understand, agree and acknowledge that we may modify, suspend, disrupt or discontinue the Platform, any part
      of the Platform or the use of the Platform, whether to all clients or to you specifically, at any time with or
      without notice to you. You agree and acknowledge that we will not be liable for any of the aforementioned actions
      or for any losses or damages that are caused by any of the aforementioned actions.</p>
    <p>The Platform depends on various factors such as software, hardware and tools, either our own or those owned
      and/or operated by our contractors and suppliers. While we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the
      Platform’s reliability and accessibility, you understand and agree that no platform can be 100% reliable and
      accessible and so we cannot guarantee that access to the Platform will be uninterrupted or that it will be
      accessible, consistent, timely or error-free at all times.</p>

    <h2>12.8 NOTICES</h2>
    <p>Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all notices given by you to us must be given to Mindset CBT at <a

      register, or in any of the ways specified in section 13.7 above. Notice will be deemed received and properly
      served immediately when posted on the Products or when an e-mail or other electronic communication is sent. In
      proving the service of any notice via email, it will be sufficient to prove that such e-mail was sent to the
      specified e-mail address of the addressee.</p>

    <h2>12.9 ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2>
    <p>These Terms and any document expressly referred to in them constitute the whole agreement between us and
      supersede all previous discussions, correspondence, negotiations, previous arrangement, understanding or agreement
      between us relating to their subject matter. We each acknowledge that neither of us relies on, or will have any
      remedies in respect of, any representation or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set
      out in these Terms or the documents referred to in them. Each of us agrees that our only liability in respect of
      those representations and warranties that are set out in this agreement (whether made innocently or negligently)
      will be for breach of contract. Nothing in this section limits or excludes any liability for fraud.</p>

    <h2>12.10 THIRD PARTY RIGHTS</h2>
    <p>A person who is not party to these Terms will not, subject to section 12 (DMCA), have any rights under or in

    <h2>12.11 LIMITATION OF Mindset CBT’S LIABILITY</h2>
    <p>(a) We will use reasonable endeavors to remedy faults in the Products. If we fail to comply with these Terms,

        provider and/or any damage that occurs due to information submitted by you not being received by us or not being
        received promptly or not being considered, as a consequence of technical faults with our software or hardware
        (whether or not they are within or outside of our control).</li>
      <li>(ii) Any loss or damage due to viruses or other malicious software that may infect your Device, computer
        equipment, software, data or other property caused by you accessing, using or downloading from the Products, or

      <li>(iii) Any use of websites linked to the Products but operated by third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>(b) TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, Mindset CBT AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, CLIENTS OR LICENSORS
      (COLLECTIVELY, THE “PROTECTED ENTITIES”) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY
      OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOSSES, WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT, ARISING FROM OR DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RELATED TO, THE
      USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE, THE PRODUCTS OR THE CONTENT, MATERIALS AND FUNCTIONS RELATED THERETO, YOUR
      PROVISION OF INFORMATION VIA THE PRODUCTS, OR LOST BUSINESS OR LOST SALES, OR ANY ERRORS, VIRUSES OR BUGS
      CONTAINED IN THE PRODUCTS, EVEN IF SUCH PROTECTED ENTITY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILTY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO
      EVENT SHALL THE PROTECTED ENTITIES BE LIABLE FOR OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CONTENT POSTED, TRANSMITTED, EXCHANGED
      OR RECEIVED BY OR ON BEHALF OF ANY USER OR OTHER PERSON OR THROUGHOUT THE PRODUCTS. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE TOTAL
      AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE PROTECTED ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN
      CONTRACT OR TORT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING FROM THESE TERMS OF USE OR YOUR
      USE OF THE PRODUCTS EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT, IF ANY, PAID BY YOU TO Mindset CBT FOR YOUR USE
      OF THE PRODUCTS IN QUESTION.</p>
    <p>(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you assume full responsibility for your own use of the Products. In
      no event shall Mindset CBT be liable to you, your heirs, or assigns or to any third party for any loss, death,
      damage, or bodily injury that you suffer, or that you cause to any third party, in connection with your use of the
      Products or other activities you undertake in connection with your use of the Products.
      Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above
      limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.</p>
